Training the next generation of academics-entrepreneurs




I believe that we, as African mathematicians or scientists more generally, have more to offer to the world than just being academics and publishing research papers. Instead of also being fully into industry, there is a way we could do both and be efficient at this frontier.

It was a journey I was to embark on alone, but I believe that together we are stronger. I have decided to upgrade my skills to fit more the job market, outside the classroom. Ultimately, I would like to own a startup. I already have a ready-made plan (more or less detailed) for that and this is meant to occupy us for six months: 

- Phase 1: from 17th October 2022 to the 31st March 2023.
- Phase 2: LOADING !!!
- Phase 3: LOADING !!!
- . . .

The idea is to spend from one (1) to three (3) hours everyday (excluding Saturdays and Sundays) on some IT/programming related concepts. The programme does not assume any prior knowledge of anything, beside basic mathematics.

In order to give you sufficient time to decide whether you would like to be part of this, I shifted the start date to the 17th October 2022. Of course, people are welcome to join anytime and go at their own pace. The most important is to commit for six (6) months and evaluate your progress after this period.

Let us be the pioneers of these Mathematicians-Entrepreneurs, setting up the pace to empower ourselves, but also to provide to this youth (our younger brothers, sisters, friends) a platform to optimally use their skills and talents. 

I present to you Fr.A.I.B. programme (From Academia to Industry & Both) for which the website is still under construction. You are welcome to invite colleagues and friends who might want to embark on this and also share across your networks. Anyone can join by [filling in this form](https://forms.gle/o5PZsXxiVCUKyuTD8).


[Here](https://github.com/gabayae/FrAIB-programme/blob/main/Plan-Phase1-FrAIB-google.pdf) is a timetable for *Phase 1*, read it and then register by filling [this form](https://forms.gle/o5PZsXxiVCUKyuTD8).

I hope to see all of you at the boarding gate ~~~ SOON !!!
